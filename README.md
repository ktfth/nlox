# nlox

## Description

The project are based on the book crafting interpreters who implements a
language who has a dynamic typing system and a lot of basic features to see
how it works in practice.

### Usage

After you clone the repository, start hacking arround `lox.js` with `node`:

```
node lox.js
```

This command jump into the REPL of the language with essential features to see
the language in action. For a more deeply interaction you can run scripts
passing the path of file.

```
node lox.js examples/fizz-buzz.lox
```

With this in mind you can go beyond looking into the
[book](http://craftinginterpreters.com/).
