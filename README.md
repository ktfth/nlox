# nlox

## Description

`nlox` is a project based on the book `Crafting Interpreters`. Which guides the reader 
through the implementation of a programming language with dynamic typing system, and a lot 
of basic features, explaining how they work in practice. 

### Usage

After you clone the repository, start hacking arround `lox.js` with `node`:

```
node lox.js
```

This command jumps into the REPL of the language, where you can see the essential 
features in action. For a deeper interaction, you can run scripts, by passing
the file path as a parameter.

```
node lox.js examples/fizz-buzz.lox
```

With this in mind, you can go beyond and check the
[book](http://craftinginterpreters.com/).

## Contributions

All contributions are welcome, to give more power to the language.
